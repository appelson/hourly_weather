Git for downloading and analyzing hourly weather using "earthaccess" in Python.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide the code framework for converting calls using the `earthaccess` package in Python to CSV's. Specifically, the data that this code works for is the NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V2.0 data. You can find out more about this [https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/NLDAS_FORA0125_H_2.0/summary](data source here).
