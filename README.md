# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to download hourly historic weather information for a specific bounding box. This weather information includes precipition rates, temperature, wind speed and direction, and much more. This information is crucial when considering potential variable bias while conducting an analysis of law enforcement agency traffic stop data - see [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4331231](Weather Impact on Racial Composition and Citation Activity of Traffic Stops in the United States). Inspired by the methodology of this paper, this code provides the frame for making calls to NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System using the [https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/blog/earthaccess](earthaccess) package in Python and then converting these calls to a single CSV. Specifically, the data that this code pulls is the NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V2.0 data. You can find out more about this [data source here](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/NLDAS_FORA0125_H_2.0/summary]).
