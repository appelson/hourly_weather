# Purpose
This repository is designed to download hourly historic weather information for a specified bounding box. The data includes precipitation rates, temperature, wind speed and direction, and much more. This information is essential for mitigating potential variable bias when analyzing law enforcement agency traffic stop data. For more on the impact of weather on traffic stops, refer to [Weather Impact on Racial Composition and Citation Activity of Traffic Stops in the United States](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4331231). 

Inspired by the methodology of the referenced paper, this code facilitates calls to NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System using the [earthaccess](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/blog/earthaccess) package in Python and then converting these calls to a single CSV. The collected data is then converted into a single CSV file. Specifically, this code retrieves the [NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V2.0 dataset](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/NLDAS_FORA0125_H_2.0/summary).
