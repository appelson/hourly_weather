# Purpose
This repository is designed to download hourly historic weather information for a specified bounding box. The data includes precipitation rates, temperature, wind speed and direction, and much more. 

Inspired by the methodology of [Weather Impact on Racial Composition and Citation Activity of Traffic Stops in the United States](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4331231), this code facilitates calls to NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System using the [earthaccess](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/blog/earthaccess) package in Python and then converting these calls to a single CSV. The collected data is then converted into a single CSV file. Specifically, this code retrieves the [NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V2.0 dataset](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/NLDAS_FORA0125_H_2.0/summary).
